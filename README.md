# NoSQL

      NoSQL is quite different from SQL. NoSQL is referred as Not Only SQL. It varies from the traditional SQL which uses row and column table model for relational database management system.Firstly, we will try to understand what is SQL. If we arranged a home party and we invite only some close friends and relatives. We had arranged all the food and accomodation for them accordingly by knowing their preferences. Suppose if some of our friends came to that party without any invite. It is tougher to arrange all the accessories for them. Likewise, SQL uses schema method. It is the set of template which is predefined and we expect the data which is trying to enter into database to be precize in that format. If any last minute changes occurs in our data the SQL would struggle alot.

      The solution for this is better we arrange a open house party. So we can arrange the food and accomodation flexibly. When we didn't know what kind of data would come, it is better to use NoSQL to accept any kind of data. Here we did not use any schema method which have the set template. The most popular NoSQL database is MongoDB. There are four types of nosql database. They are,

      Document Database

      Key-Value pair Database

      Wide-Column Database

      Graph Database

Document Database

  It consist of fields and value. We can store the multiple information by using array in the values. Every data are stored in the form of document in the document database. Unlike SQL regardless what kind of data enters into thd database it stores everything. MongoDB is a famous document database.

Key-Value pair Database

  It consist of key and value. It works similar as hashmap in java and dictionaries in python. We can access the value using the hash key of the database. Redis is the famous Key-Value pair database.

Wide-Column Database

  We can have unequal number of column for each specific row. The data in the column can be filled only based on that particular row. Cassandra is the famous Wide-Column database.

Graph Database

  It divides our entities into nodes and that node connects with another node through a relation. When we run the query in graph database the output is very fast because all the relationship we formed are very clear and predefined. The famous graph database is neo4j
